# 👋 Hi, I'm Clébio Júnior

Data Scientist with over 4 years of experience applying machine learning techniques and data analysis to solve real-world business problems with measurable impact.

Throughout my career, I worked on projects involving the extraction and processing of structured and unstructured data, predictive modeling for credit scoring and sales forecasting, anomaly detection, and customer behavior analysis — always with a focus on turning data into actionable insights.

I have hands-on experience with libraries such as scikit-learn, spaCy, pdfplumber, pytesseract, and pandas, as well as techniques like NLP, clustering, and supervised learning.
